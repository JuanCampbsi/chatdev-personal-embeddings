## ChatDev Personal with Embeddings

ChatDev is an intelligent assistant designed to help developers get accurate and contextual answers to their technical questions. Using embeddings, ChatDev improves the accuracy of answers by retrieving relevant information from a pre-indexed database, ensuring that answers are always aligned with the context of the question.

## Main Features
